# C# OOP Simulation

I am just trying to mimic life using OOP. I'm just adding code, little by little, and I'm not
too sure where it will go at the moment. I am currently writing this to understand objects 
further. I plan on working on using Reflection to instaniate objects at run time to create 
people, food, etc dynamically.
