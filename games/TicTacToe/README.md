# C# Windows Form Application

  the code for the application is located inside the WindowssTicTacToe folder
  if you wish to search, but the Form1.cs file is what you're looking for.

  The application exe file is located inside the root folder as well.

  The application was wrote in C# using Visual Studio 2018.
    Visual Studio creates a nice working IDE to build form
    applications quickly and easily.

  The game starts by assuming Player 1 will always be X and Player 2 will always
  be O, and the game is set up for two players, not single player.

  A single player mode will come soon, but will be a separate entity on Github
